In this R Markdown project document, the dplyr package in R is utilized for data cleaning and manipulation. The dataset used contains flight information from major Michigan airports between 2019 and 2021. The tasks include exploring the dataset's characteristics, filtering rows based on specific criteria, handling missing values, sorting rows, selecting specific columns, adding new variables, and performing group-wise operations and statistics. Various dplyr functions such as filter(), arrange(), select(), and mutate() are applied to clean, subset, and transform the data. Visualizations, including scatter plots and line charts, are generated to analyze flight delays, speeds, and trends over time. The document provides a comprehensive overview of data wrangling techniques using the dplyr package in R.
